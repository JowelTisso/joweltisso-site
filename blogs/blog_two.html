          Often we ignore the health part in our life as we are too busy in our
          day to day activity or we are too lazy from getting out of our bed.
          <br />
          <br />
          At an early age our body seem so heavy when trying to get up from bed
          and wished we could sleep for few more hours.
        </p>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container container-center">
        <p>
          But what we all don't realize is that all this laziness adds to the
          negative health effect we are gonna face in the mid of 20's and 30's.
          <br />
          <br />
          As we all know, our body adapts to the environment and the behavior
          its being fed by us. So, our body particularly muscle and bones gets
          weak if we don't do any physical activity as it has no reason to be
          strong.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <img class="blog-hero-img" src="/image/img3.jpg" alt="" />

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container container-center">
        <p>
          And that's what contributes in our health issues in our mid 20's or
          30's as at these age we start facing the real world and start working
          which means no laying on beds for long, no extra sleep time, no
          wasting time watching movies.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, when you start working actively and try to push your boundaries
          then your body starts answering, answering you with pain, many
          different ones like lower back pain, headache, neck pain and much more
          because you were not use to pushing yourself this hard.
        </p>

        <p>
          Which prevents you from achieving your potentials and eventually cause
          health issues. So, staying fit is a part of our life every one knows
          that yet people fail to do so.
          <br />
          <br />
          And when you are engage in jobs and are busy in work then it is much
          more hard to find time for it.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, one must try to realize that taking care of our body is as
          important as breathing, as important as eating and as important as
          sleeping... for, one needs to gain full support of the body to prosper
          in life and to achieve what is to offer for oneself.
